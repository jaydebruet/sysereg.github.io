# The Syntax and Semantics Research Group (SySeReG)


The SySeReG at the University of Information Technology and Sciences is located in the Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) Floor 9, and is led by [Mr. Habibur Rahman](http://www.habibrahman.me) and [Mr. Jaydeb Sarker](http://www.habibrahman.me). At SySeReG, we develop automated techniques for improving natural language processing activities. Our work relies on NLP to extract useful information that is used as a basis for providing decision support. Our research can be summarized in the following keywords:
