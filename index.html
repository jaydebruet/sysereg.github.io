	    Syntax and Semantic Research Group is group of some young researchers of Bangladesh. Interests of this group is:
        <ul>
        <li><b>Natural Language Processing (NLP) </b>: My goal is to improve software reuse by helping developers use existing software libraries more effectively. I conduct empirical studies to understand the problems developers have when using APIs and the kind of information that helps them make better decisions. I then design automated techniques to solve these problems, such as recommending relevant code snippets or detecting API misuses. </li>
        <li><b>Semantic Parsing and Reasoning (SPR):</b> I develop techniques to help developers maintain their SPLs, or highly configurable systems (e.g., find configuration-related bugs). I also develop techniques to help developers migrate similar existing systems into an SPL.</li>
        </ul>
